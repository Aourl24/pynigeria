10/29/23, 1:57 PM - Louloû🤞: Django signals allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers about specific actions or events that occur within the application. They essentially act as a mechanism to decouple senders and receivers, promoting loose coupling and making code modular and reusable.

In simpler terms, signals allow different components of your Django application to communicate with each other without having explicit knowledge of each other's existence.

G'morning Python Nigeria 🇳🇬,

It just came to my attention that there are folks going around in the community, DM-ing people, demanding one thing or the other, hence causing discomfort.
If you ever get any strange or uninvited DM, and it doesn't sit well with you, pls report to me or any of the Admins immediately.

Thank you.

Warm regards, 
*The Admin Board*.

Pls, to those sharing Main 1 group's link, we appreciate you doing so, but pls, have mercy on we the Admins as well, we don filter taya.

WhatsApp is so limiting, and having to create space all the time, this can't keep going on, hence it'll be nicer if you share our Discord link instead, for those who can stay there, as we are migrating there eventually, but for those who can't go there, let them have @120363168942818629@g.us.

5/1/24, 2:25 PM - +234 812 132 6225: Hi guys
my name is prisca and I am a php/laravel developer diving into python, buy I just dont know the things to install and the right video to watch to get started

please highly appreciate any help
5/1/24, 2:39 PM - Louloû🤞: Hello Prisca, you're in the right group. Since you're familiar with programming environments, I assume you already have an IDE or code editor installed. Next, you should visit the Python website (https://www.python.org/), where you can download Python and install it on your system. Once installed, you can verify if Python is working on your system. Once you've completed these steps, please let us know so we can recommend some resources for you to start learning Python. Hope this helps!"
5/1/24, 2:44 PM - +234 816 201 2222: Nice. Know what exactly you want to use python for. There are many options — Web Development, Data Science and Machine Learning etc. Once you've selected one check their respective documentation.  
Still confused? Check out a few YouTube videos to get a better understanding.
5/1/24, 3:03 PM - +234 812 132 6225: Thank you so much

once am done , I will let you know

what could I be missing
5/1/24, 3:28 PM - Senwin: Lol
5/1/24, 3:29 PM - Senwin: Type in python3 —version
5/1/24, 3:30 PM - Louloû🤞: Ok, first you should type "python3" also if it still shows not found then you would have to add it to your environment variables
5/1/24, 3:40 PM - +234 812 132 6225: Okay let me do that

5/12/24, 8:35 PM - +234 813 426 3852: I even work more on PyQt5 designer, using it to design when I don't love to code from the scratch, and it can later be imported into your python file
5/12/24, 8:42 PM - +234 816 852 4477: trust me, you are making a mistake by using designer
5/12/24, 8:43 PM - +234 816 852 4477: code from scratch, you wont want to use designer on a big project, designer adds a lot of useless boilerplate codes
5/12/24, 8:43 PM - +234 816 852 4477: you can do a lot more with less line of codes, when you code from scratch.

The project I've been building is called Pyfx, it's an ai/ml based software that uses a traders trading data as well as his trading strategy combined with historical and real time data of whatever he trades on to then try trade for the user based on their strategy and how the user trades. If this seems like something you'll be interested in, click the forms link to get added to the wait-list and get notified when I launch

*Keep your résumé concise. One page is ideal for most job seekers! 📄*

In the fast-paced world of job applications, a concise resume can be a powerful tool. Here's why keeping your resume to one page is beneficial and how to achieve this effectively:

(Click & Chat with +254706943651)
📄📄📄📄📄📄📄📄

- *Attention Span of Recruiters:* Recruiters often spend only a few seconds initially scanning each resume. A concise, one-page resume ensures that they can quickly find the most important information without getting overwhelmed by too much content.

- *Focus on Key Information:* Limiting your resume to one page forces you to focus on the most relevant and impactful details of your career. This helps highlight your key skills, experiences, and achievements that are directly related to the job you are applying for.

- *Easy to Read:* A one-page resume is easier to read and navigate. It presents a clear and organized overview of your qualifications, making it more likely that recruiters will read it in its entirety.

- *Professional Appearance:* A concise resume looks more professional and polished. It shows that you can effectively communicate your value without unnecessary fluff, demonstrating your ability to prioritize and synthesize information.

- *Highlights Most Recent Experience:* By keeping your resume to one page, you naturally emphasize your most recent and relevant experiences. This is important because employers are usually more interested in your current skills and achievements.

- *Better for ATS:* Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are used by many companies to screen resumes. A concise resume with relevant keywords can improve your chances of passing through the ATS and getting noticed by hiring managers.

- *Simplicity and Clarity:* A one-page resume is straightforward and to the point, which can be refreshing for recruiters who review hundreds of resumes. It communicates your qualifications clearly and concisely.

To create a concise resume, focus on the following tips:
- ✅ *Tailor Each Application:* Customize your resume for each job application, emphasizing the most relevant experiences and skills.
- ✅ *Use Bullet Points:* Organize information using bullet points to make it easy to scan and read.
- ✅ *Eliminate Redundancies:* Remove any redundant or outdated information that doesn’t add value to your application.
- ✅ *Highlight Achievements:* Focus on quantifiable achievements rather than listing every task you’ve ever performed.
- ✅ *Use a Clean Layout:* Choose a clean, simple layout that maximizes space without crowding the page.

By keeping your resume concise and to one page, you increase the likelihood of capturing the attention of recruiters and making a strong impression.

As of July 16, 2024, OpenAI's main office is in San Francisco, California. 🌉🏢 However, specific information about which positions are currently open or which offices have vacancies isn't something I can provide in real-time.

The best way to get the most accurate and up-to-date information on job openings would be to visit OpenAI's [careers page](https://openai.com/careers) directly. There, you'll find detailed listings of available positions, job descriptions, and the application process.

Good luck with your job search! 🚀💼 If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask! 😊🔎

Its  being a while i did something intense in frontend

Just rounding up this lyrics game built using react native 



🚀 Exciting Update on My Latest Project! 


I’m thrilled to share that I’m putting the finishing touches on a new game: a music lyrics challenge inspired by the classic Piano Tiles!

In this game, players will interact with dropping lyric tiles while their favorite songs play in the background. The goal is to tap the tiles as they fall, testing both your timing and knowledge of the lyrics. It’s a unique way to combine music appreciation with gaming fun!

Building this game in React Native has been a rewarding experience. I’ve tackled various challenges along the way, from designing the game mechanics to ensuring a smooth user experience. I’m excited about how it’s coming together and can’t wait to see players enjoy it!

What is Python? 

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, automatic memory management.

What's the difference between a tuple and a list?

Both tuples and lists are data structures in Python and hold a list of values. Unlike lists, tuples are immutable - they can't be changed.


What is a dict and what's its most important limitation?

A dict is a structure akin a hash map. It stores key-value pairs, where keys are unique and it has O(1) access time. The most important limitation for a dict is that the keys must be hashable/immutable. Meaning, we can use a tuple as a key, but not a list.


What is pickling/unpickling?

Pickling is converting an object to a string representation in python. Generally used for caching and transferring objects between hosts/processes.

Is Python a Scripting Language?

Python is capable of scripting, but it is more than that. It is considered as a general-purpose programming language.

10/15/24, 5:41 PM - +254 717 684188: Some useful PYTHON libraries for data science

NumPy stands for Numerical Python. The most powerful feature of NumPy is n-dimensional array. This library also contains basic linear algebra functions, Fourier transforms,  advanced random number capabilities and tools for integration with other low level languages like Fortran, C and C++

SciPy stands for Scientific Python. SciPy is built on NumPy. It is one of the most useful library for variety of high level science and engineering modules like discrete Fourier transform, Linear Algebra, Optimization and Sparse matrices.

Matplotlib for plotting vast variety of graphs, starting from histograms to line plots to heat plots.. You can use Pylab feature in ipython notebook (ipython notebook –pylab = inline) to use these plotting features inline. If you ignore the inline option, then pylab converts ipython environment to an environment, very similar to Matlab. You can also use Latex commands to add math to your plot.

Pandas for structured data operations and manipulations. It is extensively used for data munging and preparation. Pandas were added relatively recently to Python and have been instrumental in boosting Python’s usage in data scientist community.

Scikit Learn for machine learning. Built on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib, this library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.

Statsmodels for statistical modeling. Statsmodels is a Python module that allows users to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests. An extensive list of descriptive statistics, statistical tests, plotting functions, and result statistics are available for different types of data and each estimator.

Seaborn for statistical data visualization. Seaborn is a library for making attractive and informative statistical graphics in Python. It is based on matplotlib. Seaborn aims to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data.

Bokeh for creating interactive plots, dashboards and data applications on modern web-browsers. It empowers the user to generate elegant and concise graphics in the style of D3.js. Moreover, it has the capability of high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets.

Blaze for extending the capability of Numpy and Pandas to distributed and streaming datasets. It can be used to access data from a multitude of sources including Bcolz, MongoDB, SQLAlchemy, Apache Spark, PyTables, etc. Together with Bokeh, Blaze can act as a very powerful tool for creating effective visualizations and dashboards on huge chunks of data.

Scrapy for web crawling. It is a very useful framework for getting specific patterns of data. It has the capability to start at a website home url and then dig through web-pages within the website to gather information.

SymPy for symbolic computation. It has wide-ranging capabilities from basic symbolic arithmetic to calculus, algebra, discrete mathematics and quantum physics. Another useful feature is the capability of formatting the result of the computations as LaTeX code.

Requests for accessing the web. It works similar to the the standard python library urllib2 but is much easier to code. You will find subtle differences with urllib2 but for beginners, Requests might be more convenient.

Additional libraries, you might need:

os for Operating system and file operations

networkx and igraph for graph based data manipulations

regular expressions for finding patterns in text data

BeautifulSoup for scrapping web. It is inferior to Scrapy as it will extract information from just a single webpage in a run

I just launched a new Python web framework called Nexio. It's designed to make API development faster and easier, with a focus on simplicity and performance. If you're tired of complicated setups, Nexio is here to save the day! 🚀⚡

I'm looking for some help and contributions to make this project even better. If you have any ideas, suggestions, or if you find any issues while using it, please feel free to contribute. This is a project by a Nigerian developer for everyone—so let’s make it better together! 🇳🇬

Also, if you find it useful, kindly give me a star ⭐ on GitHub. Your support means a lot and will help keep me motivated to continue improving the framework.

Check it out here: https://github.com/techwithdunamix/nexio

Let’s build something great together. Real developer talk, no time for half measures! 👨‍💻🔥

PS: If you don’t give me a star on github, I might just hunt down your motherboard! 😂

i also need help from a professional writer for helping out with documentation .
